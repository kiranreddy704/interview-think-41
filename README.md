This commit includes the complete implementation of the MVG Playlist UI. Features:  

- Add songs to the playlist dynamically  
- Display the playlist with the current song highlighted  
- Navigate through songs using Next and Previous buttons (wraparound supported)  
- Click on a song title to jump directly to it  
- Remove songs from the playlist and manage current song index correctly  
- Sort the playlist alphabetically (A–Z and Z–A)  

Files added:  
- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure  
- `style.css`: Contains all the styling for the app  
- `script.js`: Handles playlist logic, state management, and interactivity  

This version is ready to run in any browser and serves as a clean base for further enhancements like API integration or persistence.
